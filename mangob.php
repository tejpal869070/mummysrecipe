                            <p>Pickles have been around for thousands of years, No one can hardly ever imagine an Indian platter without a spoonful of pickles whether it is for veg or non-veg meal.<br/>



                                Especially around this summer season, they are good for this mango pickle. Chinna rasalu are a few varieties that are used in the preparation of pickle. Homemade Spices like mustard powder and fenugreek powder, red chilli powder along with salt are used for this preparation.  A lot of de-skinned garlic pods are added to the pickle which on marination gives a yummy taste. One can enjoy the flavour of these garlic pods and often they are washed off along with the mango pieces to enjoy the tanginess with a touch of spice as a snack to many children during summers.
